# Red_Ribbon
Created 11/2016

## Red Ribbon Project, Squaaaad
Jerrod: This project was created for a hackathon called First Hack Dallas in November, 2016. It was a hackathon for junior devs, where a team of around 5 works together to create a website for the organization Red Ribbon. I attended this during my time at the Coding Dojo coding bootcamp with 4 other students from the Dojo. We did this after the first month of learning any coding, therefore we used the only framework we knew at the time, Python with the Pylot framework. 

I created this as part of a team, using Python, Pylot, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL. I was in charge of the database and half of the backend code, while my other teammates took care of the front end code. I later finished the project on my own to use as a project for my online portfolio.
